In 2018, I started creating courses for learning the Python programming language from scratch. I invested a lot of effort, time, and money into this project. I thought I could make money with it and change the lives of many people.

After the war started, sales stopped completely, but I continued to work with the pupils and give them practice until August of 2025. Then I took a break. It was difficult for me to make the necessary decisions. And I was still paying for servers three years after sales ended.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to achieve all my goals. But I deeply regretted to lose all invested time and effort. The project's theory videos alone are over 24 hours long; if I remember correctly, there are over 180 videos. That's a lot of work. But I wasn't mentally prepared to invest the money to rework it and make something new till this day.

Today, I've taken the work and am converting the course to an open source format. He'll lose the practice sessions and exercises, but the texts, videos, illustrations, and cheat sheets will remain and will be available for viewing without registration or SMS.

I can't say how long it will take to process. It could be a few days, or more than a week if there are errors. There are almost 200 hours of webinars there.

I'll post the videos on YouTube and the texts at [http://pylot.me](http://pylot.me). The course will no longer be interactive, and my financial burden will decrease. One of my next steps will be shutting down the server with Okumy, the LMS I built from scratch to better teach students programming.

I tried to make the course better than Yandex-Practicum, and I believe I achieved more and, in many ways, more honestly. Considering that I created my own engine, accompanied almost every lesson with videos, provided practical training, and studied how the human brain works best to memorize new complex knowledge.

Furthermore, I'm confident that I succeeded. I did well at what I'm good at: creating and producing. But I couldn't win sales. It wasn't that it was a financial failure, but I was alone in the field against armies of big budgets.

I can't bury this content, and I hope it helps others. Will it bring me anything else? I don't know; I'm open to projects and proposals. Maybe I'm just a different person. I won't have a portfolio that says "I changed industries," but I will have a portfolio that says "I went into the field fighting alone." I don't flatter myself that these big companies noticed me, but my God, it was so much fun. I don't regret a thing.
